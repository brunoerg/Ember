### Meros Whitepaper: Being  Written

#### Current State
Meros is still under development and occasionally runs Developer Testnets. Anyone can participate, as long as they compile their own Node.

#### Contributing
Meros is seeking out developers to contribute to the codebase! If you wish to help out, please read the [Style Guide](https://github.com/MerosCrypto/Meros/tree/master/docs/Development/StyleGuide.md), and then pick an item from the [TODO](https://github.com/MerosCrypto/Meros/tree/master/TODO.md).
